> "Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: With great power comes great responsibility. This is my gift. My curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man."  - Peter Parker

Peter Parker also known as Spider-Man is a superhero and lives in New York City.

### Early life

Peter Parker was an orphan who lived with his aunt and uncle. Neighbor to Mary Jane Watson, he fell in love with her at a young age. Being an academically brilliant student with a gifted intellect made him becoming the victim of a bully, Flash Thompson. He also befriended a young Harry Osborn. Until the day his life changed on a class field trip.

### Becoming Spider-Man

Peter's life changes forever while he is on a class field trip and is bitten by a genetically-enhanced spider that had escaped from its container. After that day, Peter begins to develop odd abilities, such as clinging to walls and shooting web-like material from his wrists. He uses these new-found skills to his advantage, participating in a wrestling match to win some money. Peter wins the match, but the dealer refuses to give him the amount of money that was promised. Moments after Peter leaves the dealer's office, it is robbed, but in an act of revenge, he allows the robber to escape with the stolen money. Later that night, it is discovered that the robber had murdered Peter's Uncle Ben when he refused to hand over his car. After that night, Peter uses his Uncle's death as motivation and becomes the crime-fighter Spider-Man. A new evil turns up in New York, an evil known as the Green Goblin. Peter must use his abilities to defeat the menace, but he may need to take drastic measures to do so. Measures that might destroy everything he ever loved.

### Spider-Man no more

2 years Later Peter faces new challenges as he struggles to cope with "the gift and curse" of his powers while balancing his dual identities as the elusive superhero Spider-Man, and life as a college student. Relationships Peter holds most dear are in danger of unraveling as he clashes with the multi-tentacled villain Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina). Peter's lifelong love for Mary Jane Watson becomes even stronger as he fights the impulse to abandon his secret life and declare his love. In the meantime, M.J. has moved on with her life, embarked on an acting career, and gained a new man in her life. Peter's relationship with his best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), has been overshadowed by the young C.E.O.'s growing antipathy for Spider-Man, whom he holds responsible for his father's death. Peter learns to accept his fate and harness all his superhero talents to stop the diabolical Doctor Octopus in the quest for infinite nuclear power. The film ends with Mary Jane calling off her wedding and

declaring that she would start a relationship with Peter (having learned that he was Spider-Man), regardless of the danger (or complications) it might inhere.

### Spider-Man gets the symbiote

In Spider-Man 3, an alien Symbiote attaches itself to Peter's Spider-Man costume and displays the dark, arrogant, hateful side of his personality. He also discovers that the real killer of Uncle Ben is Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), who has recently become The Sandman. After some time, Peter gets rid of the costume, but it bonds with Eddie Brock, who, as such, becomes the monstrous Venom. Venom kidnaps Mary Jane, and when Spider-Man attempts to save her he is brutally beaten by the combined powers of Venom and The Sandman. He is saved by Harry, and together they fight The Sandman and Venom. When Venom attempts to impale Peter, Harry jumps in front of the glider, mirroring the way his father died. Peter then uses one of Harry's pumpkin bombs to annihilate both The Symbiote and Eddie Brock. At the end of the film, he forgives The Sandman for killing his uncle (which is revealed to have been an accident). And reconciling with Mary Jane, the trilogy ends.

## Powers and Abilities
### Powers

- Spider Physiology: After being bitten by a genetically altered "super" spider, Peter Parker/Spider-Man possesses the proportionate powers of a spider. His powers include:
   - **Precognitive Spider-Sense**: *Spider-Man possesses a precognitive "spider" or "danger" sense that warns him of impending danger by the manifestation of a tingling sensation in the base of his skull, and links with his superhuman kinesthetics, enabling him to evade most injuries unless he cognitively overrides his automatic reflexes. The precise nature of this sense is unknown. It appears to be a simultaneous clairvoyant response to be a wide variety of phenomena -falling safes to speeding bullets to thrown punches- which has given several hundredths of a second warning, which is sufficient time for his reflexes to allow him to avoid injury. The sense can also create a general response on the order of several hours: he can discern the nature of the threat by the sensation and discern the severity of the danger by the strength of his response to it. Spider-Man's spider-sense is directional and can guide him to or away from hidden or disguised weapons and enemies, Sudden and extreme threats can cause his spider-sense to react with painful intensity. the spider-sense also gives him the ability to psychologically see his surrounding environment, even when blinded or in extremely dark conditions, allowing him to navigate without worry or fear, even under normal conditions, his spider-sense helps him navigate darkened rooms, instinctively avoiding obstacles or hazards, or potentially noisy or unstable floorboards, walls or ceilings that may betray his presence, Spider-Man can also sense and dodge attacks directed randomly or by a computer. Using his spider-sense to time his enhanced reflexes, Spider-Man can casually dodge attacks up to and including automatic-weapons fire, even at point-blank range. His spider-sense is sufficiently well-linked to his reflexes to the point that a threat can trigger them even when Spider-Man is asleep or stunned. His spider-sense has helped him preserve his secret identity since it alerts him to observers or cameras when changing into or out of his costume. The spider-sense does react to those who Peter does not consider to be a threat, such as Aunt May. Spider-Man can choose to ignore his spider-sense through intense concentration, though it gets difficult as the more threatening the more danger is, and it can lose it's effectiveness if he is exhausted or distracted. Spider-Man's fighting style incorporates the advantage that his "spider-sense" provides him. His body begins to produce more adrenaline after the sense is triggered, an extension of the "fight or flight syndrome". Even that he does not have the use of his eyes Spider-Man can still use his spider-sense to help him see by sensing the direction the danger is coming from by gauging the intensity of the sense tingle in the relation of the direction he is moving. The spider-sense is also completely passive and endlessly uncontrollable.*

   - **Superhuman Strength**: *Spider-Man possesses superhuman strength enabling him to press lift approximately 20 tons. Spider-Man's physical strength is sufficient to effortlessly lift and throw objects as heavy as most standard automobiles with ease. He must also pull his punches and kicks unless fighting someone with similar or greater physical durability. Otherwise, his blows would prove fatal to a normal human being. Spider-Man's physical strength also extends into his legs, enabling him to be able to jump to a height of several stories in a single bound. Spider-Man has shown impressive feats of strength. Such as when he was able to hold a cable-car full of children with one arm and show no sign of stress. He was able to send Flash Thompson flying many meters with a single punch. Also, Spidey was able to support the warehouse where Doctor Octopus was holding a secret experiment. Also, Spider-Man has managed to overpower multiple men with ease. And his strength temporarily increased when he was connected to the Venom Symbiote.*

   - **Superhuman Speed**: *Spider-Man can run and move at speeds that are beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete.*

   - **Superhuman Stamina**: *Spider-Man's advanced musculature produces fewer fatigue toxins during physical activity than an ordinary human. This allows him to exert himself physically for much longer periods before fatigue begins to impair him. At his peak, Spider-Man can physically exert himself for several days before the build-up of fatigue toxins in his blood begins to impair him.*

   - **Superhuman Durability**: *Spider-Man's body is physically tougher and more resistant to some types of injury than the body of a normal human. His body is more resistant to impact forces than anything else. He can withstand great impact forces, such as falling from heights or being struck by superhumanly strong opponents that would severely injure or kill a normal human with no injury or discomfort.*
   
   - **Superhuman Agility**: *Spider-Man's equilibrium, dexterity, and flexibility are all enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete. He is 35 times more agile than that of any normal human being. Spider-Man is extraordinarily limber and his tendons and connective tissues are twice as elastic as the most dexterous human being's, He has the combined balance and acrobatic prowess of the 105 Olympic-level acrobats. He can also perform any complicated sequence of gymnastic stunts such as flips, rolls, spins, cartwheels, contortions, somersaults, and springs with ease. Spider-Man is also amazingly adaptive at dodging projectile attacks, even bullets fired from multiple shooters at once.*

   - **Superhuman Equilibrium**: *Spider-Man possesses the ability to achieve a state of perfect equilibrium in any position imaginable. He seems able to adjust his position by instinct, which enables him to balance himself on virtually any object, no matter how small or narrow.*

   - **Superhuman Reflexes**: *Spider-Man's reflexes are similarly enhanced and are currently about 50 times greater than any normal human, In combination with his speed, agility, and spider-sense, the speed of his reflexes allows him to dodge or counter any attack, including gunfire, even at point-blank. the speed of his reflexes also begins responding directly to his spider-sense, enabling him to lash out at negligible threats.*

   - **Superhuman Senses**: *Spider-Man's senses are heightened to superhuman levels, specifically his eyesight as he no longer needs his glasses after the spider's bite.*

   - **Organic Webbing Generation**: *Spider-Man was also gifted with the ability to organically produce his silk webbing from glands within his forearms through in front of his wrists below his hands, limited by his body's health and nutrition. These organic webs have many of the same properties as Spider-Man's artificial webbing, they require a week to decay rather than decomposing within two hours, Thanks to its similar properties, it appears Spider-Man can utilize his organic webbing any way he could with his artificial webbing. The silk is released through a spinneret near each wrist, a central web spigot orifice used for web-slinging and draglines, supplemented by several radial spigots for other types of webs connected to specialized glands. he can also shape his webbing into various shapes and structures, such as parachutes, statues, or dummies, baseball bats, full-size operational gliders, trampolines, gloves, boots, nets, air-proof domes, bandages, slings, invulnerable shields, and armor, plugs, patches, and even hammocks. A pair of flagelliform glands located within each of his forearms release a variety of elastic, sticky ensnarements and are released through minor web spigots in each wrist. Firing a thicker "rope" of webbing, Spider-Man can blend captured criminals (even those with superhuman strength) to be later picked up by police officers as well as covering a small area with an extremely sticky blob, trapping or ensnaring escaping criminals or vehicles. Spider-Man can cover an opponent's eyes, blindfolding them, or smother a handgun or a small bomb. He can cast large webs across two certain points as a sticky net to ensnare escaping criminals. Spider-Man can release long, thin strands of organic webbing in the form of web lines and draglines released from a pair of ampullate glands located in each forearm and released though a major web spigot in the wrists. By firing a thin strand of webbing at a nearby object, usually a tall building or object, then swinging with a said strand of webbing, Spider-Man can travel across vast distances quickly. When Spider-Man swings across a city on his web lines, his spider-sense guides his aim, allowing him to travel at high speeds and above street level with no concentration, confident his web lines will find secure anchor points.*

   - **Accelerated Healing Factor**: *Spider-Man's superhuman metabolism allows him to rapidly heal, more extensively, and efficiently than normal humans, he no longer needs his glasses to see after the spider's bite, and he is also able to rapidly and completely recover from any injuries perfectly without any trace of injury. he is also more resistant to diseases, illnesses, sicknesses, drugs, poisons, toxins, etc and any effect from them would rapidly wear off far much quicker than any normal human being, and retain his athletic physique with minimal exercise. It is unknown if his healing is powerful enough to his effect his aging yet or it ever will.*

   - **Wall-Crawling**: *After being bitten, Peter's skin grows a sharp, "barbed" like material and allows Spider-Man to stick to any surface, no matter how rough or slippery.*

### Abilities

- **Indomitable Will**: *Spider-Man has a strong Force Of Will, completely free of all known evil and temptation, he is incapable of doing anything evil or unjust and will struggle against doing such things, He can emerge from defeat even stronger.*

- **Genius-Level Intellect**: *Peter Parker is very smart as he has an expert in all kinds of science. Peter goes from a science whiz in high school to a laboratory assistant of Dr. Connors and a brilliant Columbia University physics student who is at the top of his class as he becomes secure with his dual roles.*

- **Science Major**: *His knowledge of science has impressed the likes of Norman Osborn, Otto Octavius, and Doctor Connors. Considered a genius by Harry and Gwen, he has shown himself to be knowledgeable in mechanics, quantum mechanics, photonics, nuclear fusion, acoustics, and technology.*

- **Skilled Photographer**: *Peter is a very skilled photographer.*

- **Expert Acrobat**: *Thanks to his superhuman agility, speed, equilibrium, reflexes, and strength, Peter is a very skilled acrobat and gymnast. He is skilled in all kinds of acrobatics and gymnastics as he uses these to dodge or counter any attack, including gunfire, even in the air.*

- **Expert Combatant**: *Due to his life being bullied/pranked by Flash Thompson to acquiring amazing superhuman capabilities and combining them with his scientifically, adept, and creative mind, Peter has through time become a formidable hand-to-hand combatant utilizing a fighting style that directly complements his superhuman abilities. His methods are volatile, enabling him to rival practically all types of combatants.*

## Weaknesses

- **Spider-Sense Disruption**: *Due to Spider-Man being a host to the symbiote, his Spider-Sense will lose its effects quicker if Venom is close to him. This allows Venom to attack Spider-Man without triggering his Spider-Sense.*
