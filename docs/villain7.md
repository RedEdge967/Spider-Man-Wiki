## Personality
Before being thrown out of business by Tony Stark and Damage Control, Toomes was apparently a hard-working man who supported his family honestly. However, after being thrown out of business, he developed a dislike for the wealthy and privileged, believing that they do not care about the working class. Needing money to support this family, he became a ruthless and calculating man who was willing to commit crimes to do whatever it takes to support his family. Outside of his new criminal career Toomes continues to be an ordinary family man.

Despite his criminal career, Toomes makes it a point not to get his family involved in any of his black market business nor does he want them to find out by staying off the Avengers' radar for years. Despite his intense hatred towards Stark,, Toomes does not actively seek revenge against him either because it would draw attention from the Avengers towards his activities. He was fully prepared to quit his criminal career should his family be close to finding out or if his operations were discovered. Upon being arrested, Toomes asked his wife and daughter to move to Oregon so that they wouldn't have to see his trial and incarceration either.

Initially, Toomes was annoyed by Spider-Man and tried multiple times to get the young hero out of his way, his realistic worldview clashing with Spider-Man's boundless idealism. Nevertheless he was impressed by the hero's sheer determination and to some degree stubbornness. However, after his daughter was saved by Spider-Man, and learning that he was actually Peter Parker, Liz's date, he gradually developed a sense of respect for him and even tried to convince him to join his side. When Toomes and Parker were alone in his car, he offered Parker the chance to end their feud in a peaceful manner if Spider-Man agreed not to further interfere with his plans, however; he was still willing to kill him if he continues to fight him.

Toomes proved to still be an honorable man, as after Spider-Man ruined his operations and put him in prison, he showed some degree of gratefulness towards Parker for saving his life and his daughter's by pretending he hadn't figured out Spider-Man's secret identity yet when asked by Mac Gargan about it.

## Powers and Abilities

- Expert Marksman: Toomes was able to aim and fire a Chitauri Gun precise enough to cut through the webbing restraining Herman Schultz from a far distance.

## Equipment
### Weapons
- Vulture's Exo-Suit: Created by Phineas Mason, Vulture uses a suit made with Chitauri technology and outfitted with metallic body armor, outfitted with a pair of talons and a winged, detachable steel harness that allows him to fly. The wings consists of doubled sharp blades which are capable of destroying entire concrete pillars and can fold and cut through objects in a scissor-like fashion. The second version of Vulture's wings has a decoy drone stored in its back compartment and an add-on function which give it the ability to form a high altitude vacuum seal by bringing the wings close together.
- Chitauri Staff: A standard-issue weapon of the Chitauri troops that invaded Earth during the Battle of New York. Toomes used a Chitauri Staff to cut off the power source of a Chitauri Chariot.
- Chitauri Gun: A standard-issue weapon of the Chitauri troops that invaded Earth during the Battle of New York. Vulture uses their powerful beam gun to fire at Jackson Brice, which disintegrated his entire well-being and is capable of bisecting the Staten Island Ferry.
- Matter Phase Shifter: Vulture used technology designed by the Tinkerer to be able to turn a portion of a surface intangible and transparent, making it look like glass with a purple glow. He would notably attach this device to Damage Control trucks and even the hull of an Avengers cargo plane to pass through them to steal the supplies inside.
- SIG Sauer P229: Toomes owned one of these handguns and kept it inside his car. He used it to threaten Peter Parker when he took him and his daughter to their homecoming dance, having correctly guessed Parker's identity as Spider-Man and warning him to stay away from his business.

### Other Equipments
- Arc Reactors: Toomes attempted to steal several Arc Reactors from the Stark Cargo Plane but his plans were interrupted by Spider-Man. He attempted to steal a crate full of them but the plane crashed due to his fight with Spider-Man foiling his plans. Toomes' Exo-Suit had malfunctioned due to radiation from the arc reactors which allowed Spider-Man to subdue him.
- Switchblade: Toomes used this knife in order to free his hand from Spider-Man's webbing during their confrontation at his hideout.
