title: Otto Octavius (Dr. Octopus) (From Sam Raimi's Spider Man 2)
---

## Early life
Otto Octavius is a brilliant nuclear physicist and a scientific idol of Peter Parker, who aims to write his college paper on him. His work is connected to and funded by Oscorp, run by Norman Osborn, whom Octavius knew. Years later, Osborn would become the Green Goblin and die while fighting Spider-Man.[a] Despite this, Octavius continues his work with his wife, Rosie.

## Becoming Doctor Octopus
Two years later, Parker meets Octavius through Norman's son Harry Osborn. Octavius initially dismisses Parker until he remembers that Oscorp funds his research and that Parker is the "brilliant but lazy" student of Dr. Curt Connors, after which Octavius takes a liking to Parker because of his intelligence and shared interests. Octavius creates an artificial sun with four mechanical tentacles controlled by a back-mounted harness and a neural inhibitor chip on his neck as part of a fusion reactor experiment using tritium. However, the experiment goes awry, resulting in Rosie's death, the harness being fused to his body, and the inhibitor chip controlling the arms being destroyed. Octavius ends up in the hospital, but the arms' artificial intelligence (AI) massacre the surgeons attempting to save him and convince him to steal funds and attempt the experiment again.

Along the way, he comes into conflict with Spider-Man and offers to bring him to Harry in exchange for more tritium. To lure Spider-Man, Octavius kidnaps Mary Jane Watson and battles him atop an elevated train, which he sends careening out of control. Octavius takes Spider-Man captive, delivers him to Harry, keeps Watson as a hostage, and begins another attempt at the fusion reactor experiment. Spider-Man arrives to stop him and damages the arms before revealing his identity as Parker to remind Octavius of how he believed intelligence should be used for good. Inspired by Parker's words, Octavius regains control of his arms and sacrifices himself to sink the fusion reactor into the East River.

## Entering a different reality
In an alternate reality, Dr. Stephen Strange casts a spell to erase people's memories of Peter Parker (dubbed "Peter-One")'s identity as Spider-Man, but Parker's frequent alterations causes the spell to bring in people from across the multiverse who knew Parker's identity, including Octavius moments before his death. Believing Peter-One is his Spider-Man, Octavius battles him at the Alexander Hamilton Bridge and steals his nanotechnological suit to upgrade his arms. After discovering Peter-One is not his Parker however, Peter-One uses his nanotechnology to gain control of Octavius' arms until they are interrupted by the Green Goblin and Strange teleporting the two of them to the Sanctum Sanctorum, and encounter other multiverses supervillains. Later, Octavius reunites with Norman Osborn and learned that they both died while fighting their Spider-Man.

When Peter-One offers a cure, Octavius is reluctant, believing he does not need fixing. Nonetheless, Peter-One and Norman give him a new inhibitor chip, giving Octavius his humanity and control over his arms back. Seeing the similarities between Peter-One and his own, a grateful Octavius offers to help cure the remaining villains, but Norman's Goblin personality takes control and convinces the uncured villains to fight back. Octavius attempts to stop them, but is knocked away by Max Dillon and forced to escape. Later on, Octavius reunites with Peter-One and his version of Parker (nicknamed "Peter-Two") before joining forces with them and a third version of Parker (nicknamed "Peter-Three") to cure Dillon and fight back against the Goblin. Afterwards, Strange returns the displaced individuals back to their native universes, with Octavius taking an arc reactor back with him.
