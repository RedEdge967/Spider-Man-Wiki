## Biography
### The Amazing Spider Man
Some many years ago, Connors lost his right arm up to its elbow. As would be expected, this greatly affected him emotionally, and so Connors endeavored to find a "cure".

Dr. Connors soon came to be a scientist working at Oscorp Industries, and he met Richard Parker, a fellow employee, who wished to help Connors in his search for a cure. Though, the day that Richard and his wife, Mary, mysteriously went missing, Dr. Connors decided to totally shut down his work indefinitely. Years later, while working with some interns at Oscorp Tower, Curt Connors encountered Peter Parker, whom impressed him due to his knowledge beyond most teenagers. During this encounter, Connors did not find his name, but just thought him to be another intern.

A few days later, Peter came to Dr. Connors' house. Connors recognized Peter from the other day and, assuming he wanted an autograph, was quick to ask him to leave. However, Peter introduced himself as Richard Parker's son, and the scientist invited him in. They discussed the work that Peter's father and Dr. Connors were in, and why Connors had not approached the Parkers before. Peter proceeds to give the scientist his father's "decay rate algorithm", something he had been working on before his disappearance.

Later, Dr. Ratha, a colleague of Connors', approaches him, requesting him that he quickly find a cure for their dying boss, Norman Osborn. Dr. Connors agreeing to do what he can, Ratha leaves.

The following day, Peter met again with Dr. Connors in the scientist's laboratory. Peter proceeded to enter the decay rate algorithm in to a computer, with a hypothetical mouse being the target, but it fails to work at first. Peter continues to do it, finally getting a successful result that enables the mouse, named Fred, to grow an extra limb. Dr. Ratha approaches Connors, having seen the effects of Peter's decay rate algorithm, demanding that he starts human trials straight away, if they're to treat their dying employer. At first, Dr. Connors refuses to test people with the formula, causing him to be fired. Dr. Ratha decides to use the serum at a Veterans Administration hospital, under the guise of a flu shot. Connors, desperate to impress, injects the formula in to himself instead. Nothing happens immediately, and Curt falls asleep. When he awakes, his limb has fully regrown.

The scientist hears about Ratha's plan to inject the formula as a flu shot, and raced to intercept him. Along the way, Dr. Connors' arm, the one that regenerated, started to turn green and scaly. Just as he reaches the Williamsburg Bridge, he fully transforms in to a giant, mutated man-lizard hybrid. Unable to control his alter ego, Connors flips cars over the side of the bridge, the occupants only to be saved by Spider-Man.

The Lizard goes to the sewers, near to where Dr. Connors has constructed an underground lab. Spider-Man, having the suspicion that the Lizard is Dr. Connors himself, follows him. He proceeds to take a picture of the Lizard, via means of carefully-placed webs, but the camera is destroyed by the Lizard, not before he reads the camera's owner's name. Dr. Connors, as the Lizard, follows Peter Parker to his school. After ripping through the school to find him, the two finally engage in a battle. While Spider-Man's webs subdue the Lizard, they ultimately fail to do any harm.

After a quick battle, the Lizard runs through the streets of Manhattan. Aiming to reach Oscorp Tower, he finally gets there, having turned some police officers that subdued him in to lizard-men. The scientist-turned-lizard tries to get a machine that will release a toxic cloud, causing all humans to turn to a lizard-hybrid, like him. Gwen Stacy, his protégée, tries to stop him from taking it, but he wins over, not wanting to harm her.

Dr. Connors climbs to the top of Oscorp Tower, planning to release a gaseous cloud turning the human race in to lizard cross-species. Before he can do this, Spider-Man arrives. The two proceed to fight. George Stacy, captain of the police force, assists Spider-Man, knowing his true identity. Captain Stacy uses a shotgun to injure the Lizard, but this does next to nothing to the huge beast. Dr. Connors, not having control of his mind, stabs the cop with his claws.

Meanwhile, Spider-Man finally reaches the peak of the tower, and is able to replace the machine with an antidote to Connors' serum. Peter releases the cloud, causing the Lizard to turn back to an injured Dr. Connors, as well as changing the former police that became cross-species.

Following the ordeal, Dr. Connors is locked up in Beloit Psychiatric Hospital. He is visited by a mysterious man, seemingly familiar to the scientist. The man asks if Connors told Peter the truth about his father, but Curt demands Peter be left alone before the man mysteriously disappears.

The trial of Dr. Curt Connors came to an end as the former geneticist for Oscorp Industries was found guilty on all twenty counts for which he was indicted, including the murder of NYPD Captain George Stacy. Connors and his attorney, Anne Weying, were unable to convince the jury that he was not responsible for his deadly actions while transformed. His defense that he only injected himself with the serum that changed him into the Lizard to prevent Oscorp Industries from experimenting on innocent civilians did not sway the jury.

Next stop: Rikers. But even that is controversial. Ravencroft Institute for the Criminally Insane has said their facility is better served for housing and studying a prisoner such as Connors, but the judge has yet to rule on where Curt Connors will spend what is likely to be the rest of his life.

### Spider Man No way home
In an alternate universe's 2024, Peter Parker's identity as Spider-Man was revealed to the world. In a attempt to fix the effects to his personal life, Parker asked Doctor Strange to use the Runes of Kauf-Kal to erase everyone's mind of the reveal, however due to Peter's concerns of the effects he messed with the spell causing it to instead bring in anyone who knew Peter is Spider-Man in the Multiverse. Strange was able to contain it in time, but some people were brought in including two other versions of Parker, Norman Osborn, Otto Octavius, Flint Marko, Eddie Brock and Venom, Max Dillion, and Connors who was taken during his time stuck as Lizard after finding out Peter was Spider-Man. After arriving Lizard was found, fought, and captured by Doctor Strange.

Since he was the first to be held in the New York Sanctum Connors witnessed as Peter, MJ Watson, and Ned Leeds captured the rouge visitors. After Max Dillion was captured, Dillion explained Connors' original plan which caused Connors to defend his plan and commented on Max's new look, shocking everyone since he hadn't spoken ever since he was caught. After most of the visitors were finally gathered, he saw as Octavius, Osborn, and Dillion realized their fates were to die in their universe after battling Spider-Man, which caused Connors to ask Max if he had died after his plan, not knowing about his survival

Strange then revealed his intentions to send everyone back with the Machina de Kadvus, which worried most of them including Connors to be doomed to die. However, Spider-Man turned on Strange to try to help the villains, which he was able to subdue the wizard. Parker offered to cure the visitors or be killed by Strange which Connors warned that from personal experience trying to fix others would backfire but deciding to come anyways.

Parker along Osborn and May Parker took Connors and the others to their temporary house with tech to cure the multiversal men. While the others went inside, Connors being adamant to the plan's failure stayed in the truck they used to arrive, spooking passersby. The first cure was able to work on Octavius, and Parker began to develop Connors' cure. Unfortunately, Norman's powers had caused him to have another villainous personality The Green Goblin. The Goblin took control of Osborn and caused chaos in the building. Connors took the opportunity to attack Peter due to his point being proven, and not wanting to be captured by the authorities taking the advantage of Goblin's and Connors' chaos and escaped, with Goblin killing May to enrage Parker.

While outside, Connors saw Peter's city-wide broadcast to lure the villains, revealing he was going to send them home from the Statue of Liberty. Connors, not wanting to risk dying, confronted Peter, only to realize that he had teamed up with Connors' Spider-Man and another version of them. Connors temporarily teamed up with Dillion and Marko to take the three Spider-Men down. When Connors' found MJ and Leeds, he attacked them only to be knocked outside by the native Peter, during which Connors accidently took a bite of the canister containing the cure, instantly curing Connors. Peter welcomed Dr. Connors and asked for him to stay safe till he were sent home. Before everyone was sent home, Goblin destroyed the Machina de Kadvus, worsening the initial spell, and the native Peter attempted to kill Goblin but instead cure Norman, stopping the villain. In order to fix everything Peter freed Doctor Strange, who was impressed by Peter's plan working, to erase everyone's memories of Peter Parker exitance, which would return everyone else home, which worked. Due to the spell and cure, a powerless Connors was returned home with a new opportunity to live a normal life.
