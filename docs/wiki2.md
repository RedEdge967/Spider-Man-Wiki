> "We all have secrets, the ones we keep, and the ones that are kept from us." - Peter Parker

This Peter Parker is an alternate version of Peter Parker that appears in the 2012 film The Amazing Spider-Man, the 2014 film The Amazing Spider-Man 2.

### Early Life

At a young age, Peter Parker's parents are said to have died in a plane crash, leaving him to be raised by Ben and May Parker. In high school and his teenage years, Peter Parker is an outsider and trying to find his place in life. All the while, he is trying to impress his crush, Gwen Stacy.

### The Discovery

One day, when a leak occurs in the plumbing of the basement of his home, Peter finds a briefcase that belonged to his father. When he shows it to his aunt and uncle, his uncle proceeds to tell him about the relationship between his father and his lab partner, Dr. Curt Connors. This leads Peter to research his father's work; a search which takes him to OsCorp. There, he impresses Dr. Connors with his knowledge of science. After accidentally running into a man with some files, which include one of his father's area of work, he follows the man to a room full of spiders. After accidentally de-activating the machine which holds the spiders, one lands on the back of his neck and bites him.

On a train-ride home, Peter falls asleep, only to be woken up by a tiny drop via a man placing a beer bottle on his head. When he wakes up, he jumps and sticks to the ceiling of the car. When he manages to get down, he accidentally injures nearly every passenger on the train through several mishaps. The next morning, Peter wakes up and attempts to brush his teeth, only to end up destroying his bathroom in the process. After doing some research, he discovers that he has been genetically altered by the spider-bite, and has become a successful cross-species hybrid.

### The Tragedy
After discovering his powers, Peter goes to the home of Dr. Connors to learn more about cross-species genetics. The doctor explains to him exactly why he abandoned the Parker family after the deaths of Peter's parents and apologizes. Peter proceeds to give him an algorithm that was included in the briefcase of his father's that he found. Connors is astounded by this and asks Peter to come to OsCorp after school.

Later at school, Peter manages to humiliate Flash Thompson in the gym, breaking the backboard of a basketball hoop in the process. His uncle is called to the school and scolds him for acting recklessly. He then informs Peter that he will have to pick up Aunt  May from from her job at 9 p.m. that night. Just at that moment, Gwen Stacy appears in the background and Uncle Ben leaves. Peter attempts to ask Gwen out on a date, but gets tongue-tied. However, Gwen understands what he is trying to do and accepts his offer, which excites Peter very much.

Later on that day, Peter goes to OsCorp and helps Dr. Connors with the decay rate algorithm. They eventually succeed in getting it to work and manage to test it out on Fred, a mouse of OsCorp. After successfully injecting him with serum, Peter heads home to find his Uncle sitting on the porch.

His uncle scolds him for forgetting to pick up his Aunt and forces him to apologize to her. Ben then gives him a speech about responsibility, which infuriates Peter, who storms out of the house. May tells Ben not to follow him, but Ben does not listen and goes after Peter.  Peter attempts to buy some milk from a grocery store, but does not have enough money. When he attempts to barter with the cashier, he is given a snarky and inconsiderate anger, adding onto Peter's already sour mood. So, when a man robs the store, he lets the man go. Unfortunately for Peter, that same crook is armed with a gun, and after a running into and getting into a scuffle with his Uncle Ben, the gun goes off and shoots Ben. Peter hears the gunshot and finds the body, crying upon seeing it.

### Becoming Spider Man
After Uncle Ben's death, Peter vows to use his powers for good by becoming a hero. He creates web shooters for himself and donned a brand new costume, making and owning the name of "Spider-Man", after saving a child from inside a burning car falling off the bridge. He then vows to protect the city as a superhero for the greater good.

Later, Peter Parker meets with Dr. Curt Connors and helps him finish a formula, which Dr. Connors later uses on himself, which turns out to be successful. However, the formula starts to help side effects, like turning his skin green. The formula then transforms Curt into a monster the news dubs as, "The Lizard". Claiming Curt's Lizard form as his fault and responsibility, Peter makes it his duty as Spider-Man to stop the Lizard once and for all.

After much fighting, The Lizard leads Peter to the top of a building where Gwen's father, George Stacy, is badly slashed in his chest area by the Lizard and apparently dies in Peter's arms. Peter vows to follow George's last words to stay away from Gwen for her safety. Peter at first keeps the promise, but later tells Gwen that failed promises are the best kind. She responds to this with a smile while in class.

### Life as a Crime Fighter
Spider-Man is first seen free falling from the sky, in a new suit. He begins web swinging, now showing drastic improvement in his web swinging skills, along with upgraded web shooters. He catches notice of a hijacked Oscorp truck that contains plutonium, through the police radio he has hooked up in his mask.

He gives chase, also showing an increased sense of humor. He knocks on the drivers door and says,"Hello? Mister criminal! (Aleksei Sytsevich rolls down window) Hey there, I'm Spider-Man. You can call me web-head, you can call me amazing, just don't call me late for dinner, get it?" This shows his growth in being comfortable as Spider-Man since we last saw him. He then saves Max Dillon (later to become Electro) from an incoming taxi. He tells Max, after Max says he's a nobody, that he needs him, and that Max is his eyes and ears, before swinging away. He manages to nab two of the criminals, but cannot get Sytsevich as easily. He gets a call from Gwen, telling him he is late for his graduation, as it already started. He sees a vision of Captain Stacy while talking to Gwen, which makes him remember his promise. He tells Gwen he will be there soon, and hangs up.

Now a little frustrated, Spider-Man catches up with Sytsevich and says impatiently,"I told you, I am running a bit late!" Right then, Sytsevich crashes into a bus, forcing Spider-Man into action to save a man who is crossing with a little girl. He catches up to Sytsevich who is attempting to escape while Spider-Man is distracted. He dodges Sytsevich's bullets in slow motion, then webs him up while whistling the original Spider-Man cartoon theme song.

He makes it to graduation on time, almost forgetting to take off his mask. Peter kisses Gwen on stage before giving the principal a high-five( the principal was going for a handshake).

### Life as Spider Man
It is then shown that a news station states that Spider-Man appearances are increasing, which reveals Peter has allowed Spider-Man to take over a majority of his life.

Scenes are shown of Peter returning home after patrolling NYC as Spider-Man, each time his suit is either covered in bird crap, wet, burnt, or torn.

At one point, Peter is at a pharmacy, as he is sick with a cold. A man is attempting to rob the pharmacy. Peter quickly changes into Spider-Man and webs up the robber. The clerk gets excited and exclaims," Hey, you're Spider-Man!" Spidey replies with," I'm Spiduh-Mun." His nose is stuffed up, so the clerk doesn't understand him as Spider-Man buys the medicine he needs, while still wearing his coat and cap with his suit.

### Meeting Sparkles
Peter arrives as Spider-Man downtown at the center of New York to see Max now as Electro. Max, who is attempting to absorb the electricity of downtown NY, is observing himself on the monitors, when he sees Spider-Man arrive. He marvels at first at seeing Spider-Man. He says,"It's you!" However, due to his unnatural blue appearance, Spider-Man does not recognize Max. Spider-Man replies with,"Who are you?" Max tells him that Spider-Man called him his eyes and ears. This seems to poke at a brain cell, where Spider-Man remembers his face, but not his name. He tells everybody that they know each other and that their fine. Max becomes distressed when he starts talking about how he doesn't know what happened to him and becomes more upset when Spider-Man does not remember his name.

Spider-Man tells Max that he knows he does not want to hurt anybody, and just wants to help Max. However, a police officer receives orders that if Max takes another step, he'll need to shoot him. Spider-Man does not know this, so he is just as surprised as Max when the police shoot at Max. Max becomes enraged, feeling betrayed by Spider-Man, he tries to electrocute innocent bystanders. Spider-Man's left web-shooter is damaged and he uses just the right web-shooter to save the civilians from an incoming car and from touching the electrified railings. Max begins to hear voices in his head, chanting," They laughed at me, they shot at me".

He attempts to absorb all the power in Times Square, but Spider-Man blasts him with water. Spider-Man gives the firemen back their hose, after swinging it like a gunslinger, and saying,"Gentlemen, it's been a pleasure, serving with you".

Spider-Man then swings over to Gwen and says,"England? Really?", then swings away.

### Reunion
After Peter hears of his old friend, Harry Osborn, returning to NYC after the death of Norman Osborn, Peter drops by during one of Harry's meetings. Although at first Harry refuses to hang out with Peter, he eventually decides to come with Peter. They are seen walking at a park, trying to catch up for lost years. When Harry asks Peter what he's been up to, Peter says he does some "web designs". When Peter asks Harry about where he went after all those years, Harry explains that his father, Norman, had sent Harry away to boarding school to, as Norman said,"Keep Harry safe".

Peter and Harry eventually strike up a conversation on girls. Peter asks Harry if he has a girlfriend. Harry replies with no, but when Harry asks Peter, he says it's "complicated". They start skipping stones across the pond. At one point, Peter skips a stone incredibly far. Harry says,"Whoa! Nice arm!" Peter replies with,"It's just in the wrist, buddy!"

### Preparation is key
After his battle with Max in Times Square, Peter realizes he has to upgrade his webs in his web shooters to keep Max from frying his butt off. He decides to test them in the basement. He ends up testing his webs with his old web shooters originally from the first movie. He hooks them up to a battery and he shocks them. They explode time after time. One web even catches fire, which causes Peter to scream in panic, for fear of burning down the house. He ends up sleeping in the basement, whereas he was unable to find a solution. However, he receives a call from Harry telling him he needs Peter's help.

### "I need his blood"
When Peter arrives at Harry's place, he asks what's wrong. Harry informs about the disease that he is infected with. It's a disease that has been passed down the Osborn family line, crippling them and making them deadly sick at a young age. Harry tells Peter that he believes that Spider-Man can save him. He believes that Spider-Man's blood can cure him of this "Goblin" disease. "I need his blood,"says Harry. He asks Peter because he thinks that Peter has a close connection with Spider-Man. However, Peter tells him that what if it doesntt work, and Harry dies. Harry tells him that it's a risk he is willing to take it. At first Peter refuses, but in an effort to keep their friendship alive, he tells Harry he will try to get Spider-Man.

### Telling it how it is
When the story comes back to Harry, it seems as if he has been sleeping for a while. As he is sleeping, Spider-Man arrives at Harry's place in the Oscorp tower. Harry awakens, not seeming surprised that Spider-Man is there, but still shows that he is grateful. However, Spider-Man looks uncomfortable being there. He already knows what Harry is going to ask, and he already has a response. Harry tells Spider-Man that he believes Spider-Man's blood can cure him of his disease passed down in his family. Spider-Man tells him no, saying that the results could cause more harm than good to Harry. Harry becomes infuriated and Spider-Man leaves.

### Complications
Peter begins to try and find out what happened to his parents and what his Dad was researching. A montage is shown of Peter posting locations and clues on his wall, moving pictures of his family to the side. He stands back and observes, but throws his hands up in frustration.

He returns home one day to see Aunt May sitting on his bed, looking at Peter's wall. She asks what it all is. and Peter claims he knows that there is something more about his parents that she is not telling him. She sighs, then says that the truth may hurt him more than it helps. She tells him that a while after his parent's funeral, some mysterious men came to the house. They told Aunt May and Uncle Ben that Richard and Mary were traitors to their country. Peter can't believe it, and Aunt May said she couldn't believe it either at first, but she said Richard was always so mysterious, that she eventually accepted it. She then says, with held back tears, that she basically raised Peter herself with Ben, saying,"You're my boy, and I won't have you getting hurt". Peter says he is her boy, and they both hug.

### "Good luck"
Peter decides to catch up with Gwen. He catches up with her, trying to make small talk. He and Gwen walk into a building, but Peter does not really notice it. She becomes a little frustrated, telling Peter that she is here for her interview to get into Oxford. Peter becomes embarrassed, then tries to testify for Gwen. He tells the receptionist down the lobby hall that Gwen is the best they'll ever get, saying she is better the student she is trying to beat into the last spot, who is a young girl, younger than Gwen. Gwen stops Peter and tells him that she knows he wants to tell her something. Peter walks away, but before he leaves, he turns back around and wishes her good luck.

### The truth
Peter, who is not satisfied entirely by Aunt May's story about his parents, continues to search for the truth. One day, when he is investigating, he runs into another a dead end. Frustrated, he throws his Dad's old calculator at the wall, shattering it. However, something falls out.

It is data left by Peter's father, Richard Parker. It leads to a secret location unknown to Peter. He decides to head to the location, as it turns out to be in an abandoned substation. At first, Peter is frustrated at not finding anything .

Then he activates something that causes the floor in the center of the station to rotate. A subway train rises from the center and stands before Peter in the center of the room. Curious, Peter decides to check it out. As he approaches the subway train, the train doors open as he approaches. Inside is a lab built within the train. As Peter looks around, he sees a computer that shows a video of his father. When he clicks play, he begins to realize that his Aunt May was lied to.

Richard Parker starts off explaining that he doesn't have a lot of time on his hands. He explains how he and Dr. Connors discovered how to create the spider formula that enhanced one's abilities and health. However, Oscorp had the intention of altering this life-changing formula into a biological weapon. Richard refused to allow his creation be used for such evil intentions. Thus, he destroyed all of the experimental spiders and changed the codex of the spider DNA formula to be only compatible with his own blood. Peter then realizes that's why the spider bite he received never killed him, but instead granted him amazing abilities. As the video comes to a close, Richard explains that Oscorp is coming for him, and he has to leave, sad that he has to leave Peter behind. Then a young Peter can be heard in the background, calling for Richard, which explains where and why Richard was hiding in the first film. Peter cries, realizing his father had died for a purpose and had loved Peter more than he knew.

As Peter leaves the abandoned station, he sees he has a message from Gwen. Gwen explains that she is leaving for Oxford and says that she still loves him. Peter ultimately decides to catch up with her before she leaves.

### Turning Point
Peter and Gwen are suddenly interrupted by a citywide blackout. Peter immediately knows that it is Electro, as they see bursts of electricity coming from an Oscorp Power Plant. Peter swings Gwen back down to the streets, telling her he is going after Electro. When Gwen asks him how he'll beat Electro again, Peter says he does not know, that he couldn't create a webbing that blocks electricity. Gwen then tells him to try a car battery, which she then resumes to boast about how she is smarter. Because of her insistence to come, Peter is forced to web Gwen's hand to the hood of a police car, telling her he loves her. This causes Gwen to yell,"Peter!" in the middle of a crowd. Luckily, no one hears her.

Spider-Man swings to the Oscorp Power Plant in time to see Electro. Electro says that once he absorbs all the electricity, he'll be like a god. Spider-Man replies by saying,"A god named Sparkles?", which enrages Electro. Spider-Man attempts to put Electro out again with water. However, Electro avoids it, telling Spider-Man the same trick won't work twice.

A fight ensues, with Electro showing a greater deal more of power thanks to having absorbed most of the plant already. Spider-Man is caught by Electro in his electricity, and just as Electro prepares the final blow, Gwen arrives and smashes into Electro with the same policecarr Spidey had webbed her to. When he sees her, Spider-Man flips out and tells her that this isn't a game and that she is in grave danger. She tells him she's not leaving because she knows the grid specs and can shut down the system.

Spider-Man reluctantly agrees and tells Gwen that he can overcharge Electro like a battery, which will cause him to explode.  He informs to turn it on when he says so, no matter what.  As soon as he sends her away to the grid specs, Spider-Man sees Captain Stacy, which is a bad omen of things to come.

Electro bursts through Spider-Man's vision of Captain Stacy and attacks him.  Spider-Man begins bobbing and weaving around electric blasts, frustrating Electro.  Spider-Man plans to web together the destroyed generators and somehow get Electro to connect to it, then overload and defeat Electro.

As the battle between Spider-Man and Electro resumes, Spider-Man maneuvers around electric blasts and manages to web Electro up temporarily.  He takes the opportunity to web the generators back together.  Just as he prepares to tie them together, Electro breaks free and holds Spider-Man steadfast in a powerful charge of electricity.  Gwen looks on in worry as Spider-Man struggles to fight the electricity.  He finally manages to tie the generators together and yells, "Now Gwen, Now, do it now!!!".  Gwen presses on the button, which reactivates the plant.  The electricity surges through the web, through Spider-Man (his suit is rubberized, so he's protected), and into Electro.  Electro overloads and then explodes.  Spider-Man lies on the ground, sore, exhausted, and relieved.

### Rise of the green goblin
Spider-Man breathes a sigh of relief, believing the chaos to be over.  He even jokes around with Gwen by saying they could probably still catch her flight.  However, at that moment, a mysterious figure flying an Oscorp glider crackles menacingly and flies into view.  Spider-Man, who doesn't know who it is, senses danger and warns Gwen to stay back.  The figure flies around the plant and lands between Spider-Man and Gwen.  The stranger licks his lips and grins at Spider-Man.  Spider-Man begins to see who this stranger really is.

The stranger is Harry, who has changed drastically after he injected himself with the venom of one of Richard Parker's spiders.  Harry now has gruesome,yellow teeth and some of his hair has fallen back, along with his face being an ugly green due to his veins popping out.

Harry turns around and sees Gwen.  He looks back at Spider-Man and manages to put two and two together.  He then growls," Peter".  Peter,who is dumbfounded and shocked, asks Harry what has he done to himself.  Harry immediately blames Peter,saying that he betrayed him by not giving him his blood.  Peter protests and says that he was only trying to protect Harry.  Harry then says that Spider-Man doesn't give hope, he only takes it away.  "And now I'm gonna take yours", Harry growls.  Peter immediately tells Gwen to run, but Harry still manages to grab her before she can run.  Peter swings hurriedly  after them, begging Harry to stop this.  They eventually come to the top of the clock tower near the plant.  Harry hovers menacingly above Peter, with Gwen's life hanging in his two malevolent hands.  Gwen tries to talk to Harry, but Harry snaps back that Harry is now dead.  Peter begs Harry to let her go and fight him instead.  Harry reluctantly agrees, but then just drops Gwen.  Peter leaps up and grabs her and breaks her fall as they crash through the top of the clock tower.  He asks if she is alright and she says no.  Right then, a bomb drops by them both.  Peter takes the brunt of the blast and lowers Gwen down as he prepares to face off against his best friend.

As Peter battles the Green Goblin, their battle begins tearing away pieces of the Clock Tower.  Gwen is soon knocked off, but Peter catches her, and struggles as he tries to keep a loose clock hand from slicing his web-line supporting Gwen and while he's being choked by Harry.

Suddenly, the Clock hand slices the web and Gwen falls.  Peter knocks Harry away and makes a desperate leap for Gwen.  As he shoots out his web, he fails to catch her in time as she slams her head on the floor.  Peter then holds Gwen in his hands in despair.

### Aftermath
A few weeks later, Peter is at Gwen's funeral.  Aunt May accompanies him, but after everyone leaves, Peter remains behind.  A montage shows Peter standing at Gwen's grave during various seasons in New York.  At this time, Peter has quit being Spider-Man and crime is on the rise.  Systevic manages to escape from prison and is armed with a heavy armor suit from Oscorp.  He attacks downtown New York and claims himself to be the Rhino.

Peter is at home watching Gwen's Valedictorian speech from graduation, and he gains a new sense of inspiration and returns as Spider-Man.  A young boy who Spider-Man saved a few months back stands up to Rhino dressed as Spider-Man, and before Rhino can attack, the real Spider-Man appears and saves the boy.  Spider-Man then taunts Rhino, asking Rhino if he wants him to come over to Rhino so he can kill Spider-Man.  Rhino then yells yes in excitement, and Spider-Man tells him he'll be right over.  The final scene shows Spider-Man and Rhino charge at each other, thus cementing the return of Spider-Man.

## Powers and Abilities
### Powers
- Spider Physiology: After being bitten by a genetically modified spider exposed to the cross-species formula, Peter Parker became a cross-species himself. He used his newfound powers to become Spider-Man, his powers include:

  - **Superhuman Strength**: *Peter's muscles are stronger and more efficient as a result of the spider's bite. He is shown to be able to easily overpower normal humans, pull apart guns, destroy his alarm clock by merely hitting it, shattering the backboard of a basketball hoop at school, and doing the same to his front door glass panel when he slammed the door shut, swing at high velocities on a rope or web, and was able to hold a van with one hand while hanging from a web. His strength also allows him to jump higher and further than a normal human, easily capable of jumping from one building over a street to the next. Spider-Man's strength is great enough to lift 10 tons.*

  - **Superhuman Durability**: *As a result of his mutation, Peter's muscles and flesh are tougher than a normal human. He was capable of surviving fall from hundreds of feet in the air, hit by a tazer, and smashed into brick walls with no injuries and discomfort.*

  - **Superhuman Speed**: *He can run and move faster than any regular human and can easily outrun speeding vehicles and move faster that the eye can see.*

  - **Superhuman Stamina**: *He has a greater stamina than any normal human meaning he can perform physical activities for any extended period.*

  - **Superhuman Equilibrium**: *Peter is able to perfectly balance on any object no matter how small or narrow with little effort even with two fingers.*

  - **Superhuman Agility**: *Due to his incredible strength and flexibility, Peter is extremely acrobatic and is able to preform high jumps, somersaults, flips and the like. He's roughly forty times more agile than any normal human.*

  - **Superhuman Reflexes**: *Peter's reflexes operate so fast that with the assistance of his Spider-Sense, he is able to easily evade gunfire even from close range he's reflexes are roughly 35 times faster than that of any regular human.*

  - **Superhuman Senses**: *His senses are heightened, especially when used in conjunction with his spider-sense. He has used vibrations to sense potential enemies much like most real spiders.*

  - **Regenerative Healing Factor**: *Peter's metabolism is greater thus allowing him to rapidly heal faster and more extensively than any normal human being is capable of. He may also be more immune to toxins and alcohol and drugs or could lose their effects quicker. It is unknown if his healing is fast enough to effect his aging. he healed from the slashes that were on his chest and the gunshot wound that was on his leg without medical attention.*

  - **Spider-Sense**: *An early warning detection system that alerts Peter of impending danger via a tingling or buzzing sensation in his skull, where it is coming from and how to avoid it, the stronger the tingling, the more imminent and threatening the danger is, Peter can ignore it through intense concentration, although it gets difficult the more threatening the danger is, or it can lose some effectiveness if he is exhausted or distracted. This power is passive and not fully controlled by Peter.*

  - **Wall-Crawling**: *Spider-Man's exposure to the mutated spider venom induced a mutagenic, cerebellum-wide alteration of his engrams resulting in the ability to mentally control the flux of inter-atomic attraction (electrostatic force) between molecular boundary layers. This overcomes the outer electron shell's normal behavior of mutual repulsion with other outer electron shells and permits the tremendous potential for electron attraction to prevail. The mentally controlled sub-atomic particle responsible for this has yet to be identified. This ability to affect the attraction between surfaces is so far limited to Spider-Man's body (especially concentrated in his hands and feet) and another object, with an upper limit of several tons per finger. This ability appears to be consciously used.*

### Abilities
- **Genius-Level Intellect**: *Peter is very smart, specifically in chemistry and physics. He is smart enough to perfect his father's webbing formula and to construct working mechanical web-shooters. He also apparently solves a formula that is key to creating the formula that mutates Curt Connors into the Lizard.*

- **Skilled Acrobat**: *Due to his superhuman physical abilities, Peter easily surpasses normal acrobats and is able to preform somersaults, flips, spins, cartwheels, etc.*

- **Skilled Combatant**: *Using a mixture of his superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, speed, equilibrium, Spider-Sense, and Web-Shooters, Peter is able to utilize an devastating acrobatic fighting style that makes him a formidable opponent and allowed him to easily take down thugs, cops and even the more physically powerful Lizard.*

## Paraphernalia
### Paraphernalia
- **Web-Shooters**: *Peter created devices that he could strap to his wrists that were capable of shooting a special web fluid. It appears to be able to hold more than one web cartridge in case more is needed. Later he makes another pair of web-shooters.*

### Transportation
- **Web-Slinging**: *Peter uses his web-shooters to travel throughout New York City by swinging on his web-lines.*
