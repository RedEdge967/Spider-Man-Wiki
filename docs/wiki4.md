-Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse

### Plot
Brooklyn based Miles Morales struggles to live up to the expectations of his father, police officer Jefferson Davis, who sees Spider-Man as a villian. Miles adjusts to his new school and visits his uncle Aaron Davis, who takes him to an abandoned subway station to paint some graffiti. Miles is bitten by a spider which has an element of radioactivity in its DNA structure and gains spider-like abilities similar to Spider-Man. Returning to the station, Miles discovers a device (the super collider) built by Wilson Fisk's minion Olivia Octavius, Fisk hopes to use it to travel across parallel universes to bring back his late wife and son, whose deaths he inculpates on Spider-Man. Miles looks on as Spider-Man attempts to (unsuccessfully) disable the super collider while fighting the Green Goblin, and the Prowler.

Spider-Man manages to rescue Miles, but Green Goblin knocks Spider-Man into the super collider, causing a detonation that kills the Goblin and maims Spider-Man. Spider-Man then gives Miles a USB flash drive designed to disable the collider, warning that the machine could destroy the city if reactivated. Watching as Fisk kills Spider-Man, Miles flees with Prowler in pursuit, eventually losing him. As the world mourns Spider-Man's death, Miles tries to honor his legacy. He accidentally damages the drive. At Spider-Man's grave, Miles meets Peter B. Parker, an older version of Spider-Man from another universe. Upon meeting him, Miles discovers his ability to discharge "venom-blasts".

Peter B. Parker  agrees to train Miles in exchange for help stealing data to create a new flash drive. They sneak into Fisk's research facility, and Miles finds out  he has the power to become invisible. They sneak into Fisk's research facility and Miles discovers that he has the power to become invisible. They are ambushed by Olivia Octavius, who tells them that Peter will die of cellular degeneration if he stays in their universe. After being chased from the laboratory  into the forest, they are rescued by Gwen Stacy, a Spider-Woman from another universe. They then visit May Parker (Dead Peter's aunt), who is harboring more spiders from other universes: Noir Spider-Man, Peni Parker, and Spider-Ham. They are also weakening due to cell decay. Miles 
offers to disable the collider so they can return home, but he is told he has no experience.

Upset, Miles goes to Aaron's home. He ends up discovering that Aaron is the prowler, and returns to May's house. He is followed by Fisk, Prowler, Tombstone, Olivia, Scorpion,  and Tombstone. In the resulting fight, Miles reveals his identity to Prowler just as the Prowler is about to kill him. Not wanting to kill Miles, Aaron spares his life, only to be shot by Fisk. Meanwhile, Office Jefferson arrives on the scene and witnesses Miles fleeing, leading him to hold Spider-Man responsible for Aaron's murder.
The Spider's retreat to Miles room. Peter binds Miles for his own safety and leaves with the others.

Office Jefferson shows up outside Miles' door and, under the impression Miles does not want to speak to him, apologizes for his mistakes and motivates Miles. Miles then manages to control his powers and uses them to escape his binds. He takes Aunt May's help to create a new suit. He joins the other Spiders. Miles battles Fisk, which catches the attention of Jefferson, who realizes that Spider-Man isn't the villain he though he was. Miles uses his venom blast to thrust Fisk at the collider kill switch, causing it. The city is saved, Fisk and his minions are arrested for their crimes. Jefferson recognizes Spider-Man as a hero.
Miles adapts to the responsibilities of his new life, while the Spiders return to their own universes.
