## Biography
### The Amazing Spider Man 2
Max Dillon lived his whole life without anybody merely acknowledging his existence. One time, the Manhattan hero Spider-Man bumps into him on the streets and tells him, "You're my guy. You're my ears and eyes on the street". Being the outcast that Dillon was, he was thrilled to have been acknowledged by somebody, let alone the very famous Spider-Man.

As Spider-Man leaves, Dillon starts to believe that he is an accomplice to the hero. He goes mad with "love" for Spider-Man, constantly thinking about him and the fact that he could help him in any way. After his mother forgets his birthday, Max is placing a large electrical wire into a vent at Oscorp when he is suddenly electrocuted. He falls, dragging the wire with him, into a tank full of genetically altered electric eels. They bite him multiple times and the tank shatters from their charge. The genetic transfusion causes Max to become a living electrical generator, surging his body with electricity as he absorbed the charge from the electric eels, turning his skin translucent blue and giving him the power to manipulate electricity.

After being inadvertently humiliated in Times Square by Spider-Man, Max begins feeling that he is betrayed by love, his family and his job. He wants to rid the world of power so that everyone can feel what he once felt. Electro also feels betrayed by Spider-Man and fights him with his powerful electrical abilities. When Harry Osborn is removed as CEO of Oscorp and was framed for being involved in Dillon's accident, he breaks out Electro from Ravencroft and allies with him to overthrow Donald Menken from the board, in exchange for giving him access to Oscorp's power grid, which he designed.

Electro causes a citywide blackout, challenging Spider-Man. However, with the help of Gwen Stacy, Spider-Man defeats Electro at the power plant by overloading his electricity supply by reflecting his power back to him, causing him to violently explode into millions of particles.

### Spider-Man No way home
Due to a botched spell by Doctor Strange thanks to MCU Peter's tampering of the spell, Electro was transported to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the woods near some electric wires, moments before he explodes due to being overloaded with electricity, much to his confusion. The power of the electricity, however, makes him become more enhanced than ever. He promptly faces off against the MCU Spider-Man, who is defended by Sandman, to which MCU Spider-Man brings down two towers to depower Electro and send him to be imprisoned in the Sanctum. Being depowered restores Electro to his physical form and original appearence, much to his surprise. Knowing that most of the foes from the other universes would die battling their Spider-Man, the MCU Peter steals the box that contains the botched spell to cure every one of them and rehabilitate them.

Unlike most of the villains, Electro wasn't willing to cure himself due to loving how powerful he feels in this universe, refusing to leave. He has a friendly conversation with Sandman on how they got their powers. He then takes keen interest on the Arc Reactor Tony Stark built, marvelled by how powerful it is. Electro then accepts Peter's attempts to cure him, who places a device that would drain most of the electricity from Max's body, but before it nearly completes, the Green Goblin takes control over Norman Osborn's body again and destroys the device, convincing him and Sandman to turn against Spider-Man and return to villainy.

Eventually, the other 2 Spider-Men come and join forces with the MCU Spider-Man to face off against all the villains, providing them a tough battle to fight, with Electro not wanting to be cured of his powers and being powered by an Arc Reactor that he'd stolen. Eventually, Doctor Octopus comes and pretends to help Electro by grabbing the Raimi and Webb Spider-Men, before revealing his gambit by grabbing Electro, removing his Arc Reactor and replacing it with the device that the MCU Peter had created to drain Electro of all of his extra electricity. Feeling powerless and a nobody again, the Webb Spider-Man comes to console him, encouraging him to try again in life and redeem. After Doctor Strange enacts another spell he made to the MCU Spider-Man to make everyone in the universe to forget he is Peter Parker, Electro, Lizard and the Webb Spider-Man return to their universes.
