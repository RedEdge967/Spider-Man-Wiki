title: Green Goblin (From Sam Raimi's Spider Man 1)
---

## Background
Norman Osborn is the founder of Oscorp Industries, doubling as CEO. He is the father of Harry Osborn, who he has somewhat of a strained relationship with. During a school field trip, Osborn is introduced to Harry's best friend Peter Parker, whose intelligence impresses Osborn.[a]

## Becoming the Green Goblin
Later that day, Osborn hears his colleague Dr. Mendel Stromm reveal to military officials overseeing the super-soldier project that some of the test subjects have gone insane, he is threatened with a tight deadline, deciding to experiment on himself. The process develops an alternate, crazed personality of Osborn, who kills Stromm. Osborn, under the influence of his new "Goblin" persona, kills the military officials and Quest Aerospace scientists present at the super-soldier test. Although Quest's prototype is destroyed, the company decides to expand and assumes control of Oscorp on the condition that Osborn steps down as CEO. During a festival in Times Square, the Goblin kills the Oscorp board of directors, meeting Spider-Man in the process. The Goblin leads his next attack at the Daily Bugle editor-in-chief J. Jonah Jameson, who dubbed Osborn's split-personality as the Green Goblin, for who takes pictures of Spider-Man. Spider-Man shows up behind the Goblin, so the Goblin offers him a partnership and belittles his choice to become a hero, warning that, eventually, the city will turn against him. The Goblin baits Spider-Man to a burning apartment, asking if he accepted his offer, to which the latter refuses to work with him.

After Thanksgiving dinner with Parker, his aunt May, Harry and his girlfriend Mary Jane Watson, Osborn deduces that Spider-Man is the dual identity of Parker and despite begging the Goblin not to hurt him, attacks and hospitalizes May and later kidnaps Watson. The Goblin makes Spider-Man choose whether to save Watson or a Roosevelt Island Tramway car full of children, but Parker saves both. The Goblin brutally beats Spider-Man but Parker brutally counterattacks him, thinking to fool him by unmasking himself as Osborn. Osborn states that Parker was like a son to him, while the Goblin attempts to impale Parker with the glider but the latter dodges and instead, the glider fatally stabs Osborn, telling Parker not to tell Harry about his deeds done as the Goblin.

## Legacy
In the original timeline, Harry mourns the loss of his father at his funeral, and vows vengeance on Spider-Man after witnessing the vigilante bring Osborn's body dead, while Parker rejects Watson.[a] Octavius also attends his funeral.[N 1] Following his death, Osborn's identity as the Green Goblin and death was widely reported on, causing Harry to live in denial over his father's true identity for two years.[N 1]

It was only after Harry discovers Spider-Man’s identity as Peter Parker that he is haunted by a hallucination of Osborn demanding to be avenged, with Harry discovering a hidden lair containing Green Goblin’s arsenal and became the "New Goblin" a year later in his father’s memory. Osborn's presence later appears after Harry recovers his memories after his first encounter with Parker, reminding Harry to avenge him and to go after Parker's heart. However, Harry eventually finds out the truth about his father's death and gives up his vendetta against Parker, helping him in a battle against Marko and Eddie Brock / Venom and giving his own life to save his friend.

## Entering an alternate reality
In an alternate reality, Dr. Stephen Strange casts a spell to erase people's memories of Peter Parker's (nicknamed "Peter-One") identity as Spider-Man, but Parker's excessive stipulations cause the spell to bring in people from across the Multiverse who know Spider-Man's identity, including Osborn moments before his death. The Green Goblin encounters Peter-One and Otto Octavius at the Alexander Hamilton Bridge, but they are teleported to the Sanctum Sanctorum before he can attack. Afterwards, Osborn regains control of his body and mind as he tries to get away from the Green Goblin by abandoning his glider in an alleyway. Osborn is taunted by his alter ego and he breaks the Goblin mask and seeks help and refuge.

Osborn wanders into F.E.A.S.T. where he meets an alternate May Parker. Osborn realizes that Peter-One is not his version of Parker, when he sees him without his mask. Osborn goes with Peter-One to the Sanctum Sanctorum where he reunites with Octavius, and the two find out that they died in their universe while fighting their Spider-Man. Osborn works with Peter-One to cure the multiversal individuals including Octavius, Flint Marko, Curt Connors, and Max Dillon. While working with Peter-One, Osborn is impressed with his kindness and intelligence, seeing much of his Peter in him. However, the Green Goblin retakes control of Osborn's mind, and convinces the rest of the group, except for Otto Octavius, to turn on Peter-One and battles him through Happy Hogan's apartment. In the lobby, the Goblin summons his glider and throws a pumpkin bomb, causing the apartment to explode. He proceeds to fatally stab May with it and escapes.

After Connors, Marko, and Dillon are cured with help from Octavius, the Goblin attacks and destroys the contained spell from Strange, causing the barriers between universes to break. While Strange attempts to seal the barriers, an enraged Peter-One nearly kills the Goblin but is stopped by the Parker from Osborn's universe (nicknamed "Peter-Two"), whom the Goblin stabs in the back. Peter-One and another version of Parker (nicknamed "Peter-Three") inject the Goblin with a cure Parker developed, restoring him to a remorseful Norman Osborn. Afterwards, Strange casts a spell to make the alternate world forget Peter-One's existence, causing Osborn, Octavius, Marko, and their Peter Parker to return to their universe.

## Abilities and Equipment
The Green Goblin pilots a high-tech jet glider, armed with seeking missiles and machine guns. His suit consists of green armor that cybernetic-ally connects him to his glider and weapons. He is seen using three varieties of his signature "Pumpkin Bombs": one which is a simple explosive; one that releases a bright, radioactive flash which reduces people to skeletons; and one that splits into flying, razor-bat blades.

Rather than carrying a shoulder "bag of tricks", the weapons are contained in the glider and are ejected individually out of their storage compartment when desired. His suit is armed with knockout gas that is released from the wrists.

His suit is also linked to the Goblin Glider, allowing him to control it remotely. Green goblin has superhuman strength capable of beating Spider-Man in battle using his hand to hand combat (though Spider-Man was hurt) he can also break Spider-Mans web which is like metal really easily.

He even shows strength when he punches a wall when Spider-Man ducks in the final battle and he busted the wall completely showing his strength of his blows. He has a shiny trident specifically to kill Spider-Man. His armor protects him from majority of injuries so he 's barely being hurt or damaged from fighting unlike Spider-Man. It's only damaged when Spider-Man brings down a brick wall which made his suit finally experience dents and scratches.

In the Spider-Man movie game, Green Goblin is able to run really fast using superspeed if the player plays as him. It is unknown if he could be able to use this ability since it is exclusive in the game.
